# Alternative Examples

These examples show alternative approaches to connecting to Aurora DSQL when the standard connector doesn't meet your needs.

## When to Use Alternatives

Use the [preferred example](../example_preferred.go) unless you have specific requirements:

| Alternative | Use When |
|-------------|----------|
| [manual_token](./manual_token/) | You need custom token generation logic, non-standard authentication flows, or want to understand the underlying mechanism |

## Running Alternatives

Each alternative has its own directory with an example and test. See the README in each directory for specific instructions.
